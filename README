## Case Study Artifacts for the paper "Modelling and Verification of Security-Oriented Resource Partitioning Schemes"

### Directory layout:

```
.  
├── COLORIS (COLORIS model and proof scripts using UCLID5)
├── DAWG (DAWG model and proof scripts using Verilog + SymbiYosys)
└── README.md
```

Each directory also has a corresponding README and run scripts.

### Prerequisites: 
   
* SymbiYosys: You can install the OSS CAD suite from [the GitHub page](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build). For your convenience we provide a script (`run_symbiyosys.sh`) in `DAWG` that grabs a recent version of the suite.
* UCLID5: You can access the UCLID5 tool from the GitHub page [here](https://github.com/uclid-org/uclid). Note that this experimentation suite requires a recent version of UCLID5. Hence you will need to either setup a Docker-based UCLID5 version (from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/kkmc/uclid5docker/tags)) or build UCLID5 binaries from from source (binary releases will not work).
